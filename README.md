### Eventual Consistency

A consistency model that contrasts [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID). 
Named so because the final values are not synchronously known (or at least known to be consistent) - they will be, eventually.

It's academic name is BASE: *Basically Available, Soft State, Eventual Consistency*. <- this is academic mumbo jumbo, just call it Eventually Consistent.

It contrasts the ACID criterion of *Consistency*. 

This is the main argument of the CAP theorem.   

If you took Distributed Systems in your Bachelor, 
you've 100% covered it - it's also called Brewer's Conjecture. 

### Consistency

For disambiguating - consistency is better described as *linearizeability*. 

> In concurrent programming, an operation (or set of operations) is linearizable if it consists of an ordered list of invocation and response events, that may be extended by adding response events such that:
> The extended list can be re-expressed as a sequential history (is serializable).
> That sequential history is a subset of the original unextended list.

"linearizeability" sounds like annoying academic mumbo jumbo but it's actually very simple:

If you've ever played with Redis you'd know exactly what this is - Redis is single-threaded and running on an Event Loop,
meaning `read-after-write` operations always return the previous value regardless of contention on that particular datum,
in other words they perform their composite writes as *Atomic Commitments*.

linear = as in: in a straight line :)

The most straightforward explanation I know comes from this paper.

### The CAP theorem 

A system that demonstrates all 3: 

- Consistency
- Availability
- Partition-tolerance

is theoretically impossible - but practically you can design an architecture that is good-enough.

The following are eventually consistency models designed to work 
in a collaborative context.

Their concepts are not necessarily new but they are considered exotic data architectures 
and a big chunk of them is still a research subject. 

#### Operational transformation

> It's distinguishing feature is that it's model requires a central
> coordinating server, whereas a CRDT does not.

> Google Docs is built around this concept and they seem to guard
> it's actual method of operation under lock and key.

## Atomic Commitment Protocols

### Consensus Resolution

> A truely distributed system will reach a point where its nodes have simultaneously awoken from failure and need to *agree on who has the correct value*.  

> This central issue forms the basis of a family of problems, called ***the consensus problems*** - they are imperfectly-solved by highly elaborate mechanisms that in one form or another use [*quorums*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum_(distributed_computing)); the nodes use an algorithm to elect a leader or a group
of trusted nodes which determine how to proceed. 

This is not something you would implement yourselves - they are very elaborate algorithms. You only need to know more or less what they do, what benefits they offer and what tradeoffs and then just pick a configuration that suits your needs. Some consensus resolution schemes are synchronous (consistent?) but 
brittle and non-scalable - other are far more lenient with consistency guarantees and thus much more performant when it comes to scaling-out.

> By far the most famous is Lamparts PAXOS family of protocols which prove that achieving consensus is possible - this is an actual proof.
> PAXOS doesn't cover [Byzantine Failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault). It's literally torture to go through the original paper,
> Lampart has rewritten it as "Paxos Made Simple" published somewhere.

> The relevant systme integration is Zookeper, a highly-available distributed orchestration service.

## Failure modes of distributed systems

### Byzantine Fault-Tolerance:

> The term takes its name from an allegory, the "Byzantine generals problem" - developed to describe a situation in which, to avoid catastrophic failure of a system, the system's actors must agree on a strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable in such a way as to cause other (good) actors to disagree on the strategy and they may be unaware of the disagreement.

> Leslie Lampart has a fetish for Greece, Paxos is a Greek island and Byzantine is .. Byzantine.

This problems more or less center around the idea that some nodes report some faulty values to some nodes and some other value to other nodes - which one is correct? How would you proceed with some action if you can't agree on whether you have some correct data in the 1st place and neither can you agree on the faultiness anyway? 

In the papers you'll see nodes being "bad" actors - obviously the nodes don't have a grudge against you - it means the nodes are producing faulty data observerd by some to be `X` and by others to be `Y` - this is a "treacherous" node.

Byzantine Faults used to be some kind of NASA-level issues because the issues they produce used to be relevant to aircraft avionics with multiply-redundant systems. They became an Average Joe problem because it's fashionable to break up systems into microservices, which effectively produces the same condition. 

Any time you hear this term, you're certainly knee-deep into seriously advanced bullshit - if you require consistency guarantees you're probably in the right place, otherwise steer way-clear. BFT configurations are usually systems that require a team just to keep it running smoothly. 


### Split-brain: 

> Similar to a Byzantine Fault but not about reaching consensous - basically you've got 2 piece of supposedly homogenous data across 2 or more nodes. A partition takes place so node A doesn't know if he has the correct data and can't know - same for node B.


### Thundering herd: 

> Example: A node has died and it's clients detect it. 
> This kickstarts an internal timer to attempt reconnect.
> Eventually thousands of clients converge on a reconnect attempt, simultaneously, which starves the node -
> by the time the node has starved itself it has propagated the failure to other subsystems
> and kickstarted a cascading failure, eventually bringing the entire system down.
> An "okay-ishly" technique to solve this, is exponential backoffs.
>
> *cascading-failures* are the most serious failure types (not modes) in distributed systems because they
> are guaranteed to result in *catastrophic failure* (failure from which recovery is impossible).
> It's like a domino-effect, which is much easier to picture.
